This mod provides continuation for our lovable Baeloth in BG2EE and EET.

![All right... but NOT because you TOLD me to.](baebg2/portraits/vivid/BAELOTHL.BMP)

> OBVIOUSLY, this was going to happen, but the amount of TIME it took borders on insanity! How do you function on a day-to-day basis?

## Introduction

Baeloth has been captured by the red wizards and is willing to make a deal in exchange for his freedom.

### Collaboration

I must say a big thank you to [Endarire](https://www.gibberlings3.net/profile/5772-endarire/), who has provided dialog and ideas for this mod. Without them, this mod would not be possible. A personal shout out to @morpheus562[G3](https://www.gibberlings3.net/profile/11591-morpheus562/), @CamDawg[G3](https://www.gibberlings3.net/profile/8-camdawg/), @K4thos[G3](https://www.gibberlings3.net/profile/6804-k4thos/) for EET, and the rest of the G3 community.

## Installation

We don't include an exe, you'll need use weidu to install:

### Move files

Copy baebg2 subfolder to your game directory:

#### Linux/Macos:

```sh
cp -r BaeBG2/baebg2 <GAME DIRECTORY>
```

#### Windows:

Copy files via explorer.exe

Then run weidu against the .tp2 file, in the game directory

#### Linux/Macos:
```sh
weidu baebg2/BaeBG2.tp2
```

#### Windows:
```sh
weidu.exe baebg2\BaeBG2.tp2
```

Should get something like this:

```sh
